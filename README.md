# skills-manage

`skills-manage` is a Tauri desktop app for managing AI coding agent skills across multiple platforms from one place.

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

> **Disclaimer**
>
> `skills-manage` is an independent, unofficial desktop application for managing local skill directories and importing public skill metadata. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub, MiniMax, or any other supported platform, publisher, or trademark owner.

## Overview

`skills-manage` follows the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills) open pattern and uses `~/.agents/skills/` as the canonical central directory. Skills can then be installed to individual platforms through symlinks, so one source of truth can drive multiple AI coding tools.

## Highlights

- Central skill library plus per-platform install and uninstall flows.
- Claude Code can surface native skills and read-only marketplace plugin skills in one platform view.
- Full skill detail view with Markdown preview, raw source view, and AI explanation generation.
- Collections for organizing skills and batch-installing them to platforms.
- Discover scan for project-level skill libraries, including an Obsidian sidebar category for vault skills (`.skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`).
- Marketplace browsing and GitHub repository import with authenticated requests and retry fallback.
- Fast search for large skill libraries with deferred queries, lazy indexing, and virtualization.
- Bilingual UI, Catppuccin themes, accent colors, onboarding, and responsive navigation.

## Download

- Latest release: <https://github.com/iamzhihuix/skills-manage/releases/latest>
- Current prebuilt packages: Apple Silicon macOS (`.dmg` and `.app.zip`)
- Other platforms: run from source for now

### macOS Unsigned Build

The current public macOS build is not notarized. If macOS shows a warning such as:

![macOS damaged app warning](images/app-damaged.png)

- `"skills-manage" is damaged and can't be opened`
- `"skills-manage" cannot be opened because Apple could not verify it`

the app is usually not actually corrupted; it is being blocked by Gatekeeper quarantine on an unsigned build.

After moving the app to `/Applications`, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/skills-manage.app"
```

Then launch the app again from Finder. If your app is stored somewhere else, replace the path with the actual `.app` path.

> Note: Claude Code also surfaces marketplace plugin directories under `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/*` as read-only rows in the Claude view. Those entries are display-only and are not managed like native skills in `~/.claude/skills/`.

Custom platforms can be added through Settings.

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-first storage** — metadata, collections, scan results, settings, and cached AI explanations stay in `~/.skillsmanage/db.sqlite` or the local skill directories you manage.
- **No telemetry** — the app does not include analytics, crash reporting, or usage tracking.
- **Network access is feature-driven** — outbound requests only happen when you explicitly use marketplace sync/download, GitHub import, or AI explanation generation.
- **Credentials are stored locally** — GitHub PAT and AI API keys are kept in the local SQLite settings table and are not encrypted at rest by the app.
- Never post real secrets in issues, pull requests, screenshots, or logs.
